    <h1>Australia's Film Industry</h1>
    <p>Australia has long been a vibrant player in the global film industry, producing both internationally acclaimed
        films and unique domestic works that reflect its rich cultural heritage. From early classics like <i>Crocodile
            Dundee (1986)</i> to global blockbusters like <i>The Matrix Reloaded (2003)</i> and <i>The Lego Movie
            (2014)</i>, Australia’s film industry has been
        influential both in terms of storytelling and technical achievements.
        <br><br>
        Australia's role in the global box office has grown significantly since the late 20th century, particularly as
        filmmakers, actors, and production teams have gained international recognition. Directors like George Miller and
        Baz Luhrmann, as well as stars like Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, and Cate Blanchett, have become household
        names. The country has also become a major destination for international film production due to its scenic
        locations, talented workforce, and competitive tax incentives.

    <h2>International Box Office</h2>
    <p>The map below visualizes the sum of the worldwide box office of domestically produced films, relative to the
        number
        of films produced in each country, from 1899 to 2024. The countries are shaded according to the worldwide box
        office revenue per film
        produced domestically. Darker shades indicate higher box office returns, while lighter shades represent lower
        returns.</p>

    <h2><br>Australian Films</h2>
    <p>This bar chart tracks the total worldwide box office earnings of Australian films from 1979 to 2024.
        <br><br>
        This
        visualization is composed of two parts: the main bar chart (at the top) that shows the total worldwide box
        office of Australian films for each year from 1979 to 2024, and an interactive selection bar (at the bottom)
        that allows users to focus on a specific time range. Click and drag along the selection bar to highlight a range
        of years. As you do so, the main bar chart above will update to show only the data for the years you’ve
        selected.
        <br><br>
        The color gradient indicates the number of Australian films produced each year. Darker shades represent years
        when more films were produced, while lighter shades represent years with fewer films. The visualization
        also calculates which year within the selected range had the highest total worldwide box office
        revenue, and displays the title of the highest-grossing
        Australian film from that year.
